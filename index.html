    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
    remaining essentially unchanged.
        It was popularised in the <marks>1960s</marks> with the release of <marks>Letraset sheets</marks> containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like <strong>Aldus PageMaker</strong> including versions of <marks>Lorem Ipsum</marks>.</p>
